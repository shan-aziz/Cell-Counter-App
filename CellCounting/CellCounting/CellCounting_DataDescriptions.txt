Data description:

This is a subset of VGG dataset. There are 20
images with a 256x256 resolution that contain simulated
bacterial cells from fluorescence-light microscopy. Each image contains 174 Â±64 cells which overlap
and are at various focal distances simulating real life imaging with a microscope.
